// Book Title
= Using Event-Drive Ansible 2.5 with Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 

You can configure a new installation of {EDAcontroller} 1.1 with {ControllerName} 4.4 or 4.5, which is considered a general availability release fully supported by Red Hat. 
{ControllerNameStart} 4.4 and 4.5 were released as part of {PlatformNameShort} 2.4.

Upgrading to {EDAcontroller} 1.1 from an earlier release is unsupported at this time.

This guide shows you how to install and configure Event-Driven Ansible 1.1 to work with automation controller 4.4 or 4.5 for a Virtual Machine (VM)-based installation.
