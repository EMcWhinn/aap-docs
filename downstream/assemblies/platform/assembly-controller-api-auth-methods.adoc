= Authenticating in the API

You can use the following authentication methods in the API:

* xref:controller-api-session-auth[Session authentication]
* Basic authentication
* OAuth 2 token authentication
* Single Sign-On authentication

{ControllerNameStart} is designed for organizations to centralize and control their automation with a visual dashboard for out-of-the box control while providing a REST API to integrate with your other tools on a deeper level. 
{ControllerNameStart} supports several authentication methods to make it easy to embed {ControllerName} into existing tools and processes to help ensure the right people can access controller resources.
