= Managing credentials

Credentials authenticate the controller user to launch Ansible playbooks. The passwords and SSH keys are used to authenticate against inventory hosts. 
By using the credentials feature of {ControllerName}, you can require the {ControllerName} user to enter a password or key phrase when a playbook launches.
