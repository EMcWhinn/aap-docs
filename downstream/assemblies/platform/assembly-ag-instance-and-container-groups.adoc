= Instance and container groups

{ControllerNameStart} allows you to execute jobs through ansible playbook runs directly on a member of the cluster or in a namespace of an Openshift cluster with the necessary service account provisioned.
This is called a container group.
You can execute jobs in a container group only as-needed per playbook. 
For more information, see [ADD XREF]Container Groups.
