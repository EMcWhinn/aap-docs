= {RedHatEdge} overview

The {RedHatEdge} provides streamlined management of edge devices and applications through a declarative approach. 
By defining the required state of your edge devices, which includes your operating system versions, host configurations, and application deployments, the {RedHatEdge} automatically implements and maintains these configurations across your entire device fleet.

With the {RedHatEdge} you gain the following benefits:

* Built for edge environments: 
** Manage distributed edge devices from a centralized platform
** Enhanced security with hardware root-of-trust
** Autonomous agent operation during network interruptions
** Simplified management for locations with limited or no on-site IT personnel

* Simple and secure life cycle management:
** Streamlined onboarding with automated device enrollment
** Secure decommissioning with complete device lifecycle management.
This includes appropriate deregistration and credential revocation.

* Scalable management:
** Declarative configuration, enabling you to specify required states for operating systems, configuration files, and applications
** Fleet-level administration, where you can apply policies and configurations to groups of devices rather than managing individually
** Real-time status reporting that gives you visibility into device health, connectivity, and configuration compliance

// The following includes benefits for ACM/AAP, this needs further work:

// Specific benefits of the {RedHatEdge} on Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes include managing your operating system on a RHEL machine consistently with how you would use it on OpenShift.

// Specific benefits of the {RedHatEdge} on {PlatformName} include elevated integration with your automations.
// You can focus more on orchestrating the environment, without worrying about updating the operating system.
