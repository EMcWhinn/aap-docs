= Container-based installation

If you have an existing {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 installation of {ControllerName} (4.4 or 4.5), you can perform a new installation of {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 which has {EDAcontroller} 1.1 and configure the two installations to work together.

If you do not have an existing {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 container-based installation of {ControllerName}, see the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html-single/containerized_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/index[Containerized Ansible Automation Platform installation guide], ensuring that you use an {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 installer.
