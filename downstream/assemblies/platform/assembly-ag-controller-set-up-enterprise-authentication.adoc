[id="controller-set-up-enterprise-authentication"]

= Set up enterprise authentication

Set up authentication for the following enterprise systems:

* xref:controller-set-up-azure[Azure AD settings]
* LDAP Authentication
* RADIUS settings
* SAML settings
** Transparent SAML Logins
** Enabling Logging for SAML
* TACACS+ settings
* Generic OIDC settings

[NOTE]
====
For LDAP autentication, see [ADD XREF] Setting up LDAP Authentication.
====

SAML, RADIUS, and TACACS+ users are categorized as "Enterprise" users. 
The following rules apply to Enterprise users:

* Enterprise users can only be created through the first successful login attempt from the remote authentication backend.

* Enterprise users cannot be created or authenticated if non-enterprise users with the same name have already been created in {ControllerName}.

* {ControllerNameStart} passwords of enterprise users must always be empty and cannot be set by any user if they are enterprise backend-enabled.

* If enterprise backends are disabled, an enterprise user can be converted to a normal {ControllerName} user by setting the password field. 
+
[WARNING]
====
This operation is irreversible, as the converted {ControllerName} user can no longer be treated as an enterprise user.
