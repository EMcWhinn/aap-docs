= Managing devices

After provisioning, you need to enroll your devices to manage them with the {RedHatEdge}.
Device management includes organizing, monitoring, and updating the operating system and applications on your devices with the {RedHatEdge}.

You can manage your devices individually or in a fleet.
Managing your devices individually is advantageous in the following scenarios:

* If a few devices have different configuration.
* If you use external automation for updating the device.
