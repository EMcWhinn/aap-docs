= Clustering

Clustering is sharing load between hosts. 
Each instance must be able to act as an entry point for UI and API access. 
This must enable the {ControllerName} administrators to use load balancers in front of as many instances as they wish and maintain good data visibility.

[NOTE]
====
Load balancing is optional and is entirely possible to have ingress on one or all instances as needed.
====

Each instance should be able to join the {ControllerName} cluster and expand its ability to execute jobs. 
This is a simple system where jobs can run anywhere rather than be directed on where to run. 
Also, clustered instances can be grouped into different pools or queues, called [ADD LINK]Instance Groups.

{PlatformNameShort} supports container-based clusters using Kubernetes, meaning new controller instances can be installed on this platform without any variation or diversion in functionality. 
You can create instance groups to point to a Kubernetes container. 
For more information, see the [ADD XREF]Container and Instance Groups section.

.Supported operating systems

The following operating systems are supported for establishing a clustered environment:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or later (RHEL8 recommended, can be either RHEL 7 or Centos 7 instances)

[NOTE]
====
Isolated instances are not supported in conjunction with running automation controller in OpenShift.
