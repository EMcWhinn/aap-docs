[id="edge-manager-install-rpm-package"]

= Installing the {RedHatEdge} RPM package

.Prerequisites

* An active {PlatformNameShort} subscription.
* Podman installed for managing containers.
* A {RHEL} host with:

** Minimal installation
** 4 cores and 16GB RAM (minimum recommended)
** Administrative access (root or sudo-capable user)
** SSH access

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that you set the `baseDomain` in the service configuration correctly. 
By default, the installation process attempts to automatically set this value based on the IP address of your {RHEL} host.

However, if your environment uses a specific domain name to access this host, for example `rhem-example.com`, it is recommended that you manually update the `baseDomain` in `/etc/flightctl/service-config.yaml` to this hostname.

Setting the `baseDomain` correctly ensures that all generated URLs, certificates, and internal configurations within the {RedHatEdge} are accurate for your network setup. 
This is especially important for integration with {PlatformNameShort} and for ensuring that the UI is accessible through the intended domain name.

You can check the currently configured `baseDomain` using:

----
cat /etc/flightctl/service-config.yaml | grep baseDomain:
----
====

.Procedure

. SSH into your {RHEL} host.
. Install the necessary repositories and packages:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
sudo dnf copr enable -y @redhat-et/flightctl
sudo dnf install -y flightctl-services
sudo systemctl enable flightctl.target
----
+
To install a specific version, use:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
sudo dnf install -y flightctl-services-0.7.0
----

. Start the services:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
sudo systemctl start flightctl.target
----
+
. Verify that services are running:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
sudo podman ps
----
+
You should see these 7 services running:
+

* flightctl-db
* flightctl-kv
* flightctl-api
* flightctl-periodic
* flightctl-worker
* flightctl-ui
* flightctl-cli-artifacts

+
. Go to the UI at the `baseDomain` stored in the service configuration file:
+
`cat /etc/flightctl/service-config.yaml | grep baseDomain:`
+
Visit the displayed `baseDomain` in your web browser to access the UI.
