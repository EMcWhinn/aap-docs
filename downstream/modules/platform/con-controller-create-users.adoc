A default administrator user with the role of *System Administrator* is automatically created and is available to all users of {ControllerName}. 
You can use it as it is or edit it later. 
You can add other users to an organization, including a *Normal User*, *System Auditor*, or *System Administrator*, but you must create them first.

For more information, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.4/html/userguide/users.html#ug-users-create[Users] section in the Automation Controller User Guide.

For the purpose of the getting started guide, leave the default user as it is.
