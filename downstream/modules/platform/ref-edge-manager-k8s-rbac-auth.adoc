= Kubernetes role-based access authorization

To set up link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[Kubernetes RBAC authorization] you must use either *Role* and *RoleBinding* or *ClusterRole* and *ClusterRoleBinding*.

[NOTE]
====
* Use *Role*/*RoleBinding* for namespace based authorization.
* Use *ClusterRole*/*ClusterRoleBinding* for cluster wide authorization (all namespaces in a cluster).
====

Use API objects *_Role_* or *_ClusterRole_* to define the allowed API resources and verbs for a particular role.

API objects *_RoleBinding_* or *_ClusterRoleBinding_* give association between subjects (example users) to a specific role.

.Additional resources

For the API endpoints, see link:https://github.com/flightctl/flightctl/blob/main/docs/user/auth-resources.md[Authentication resources]. 
Use the resources and verbs in the document for creating the API objects *_Role_* or *_ClusterRole_*.
