= Supported OSes for scan_facts.yml

If you use the `scan_facts.yml` playbook with use fact cache, ensure that you are using one of the following supported operating systems:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, & 7
* Ubuntu 16.04 (Support for Ubuntu is deprecated and will be removed in a future release)
* OEL 6 & 7
* SLES 11 & 12
* Debian 6, 7, 8
* Fedora 22, 23, 24
* Amazon Linux 2016.03
* Windows Server 2008 and later

Some of these operating systems require initial configuration to run python or have access to the python packages, such as `python-apt`, that the scan modules depend on.
