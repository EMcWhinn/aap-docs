= Launching a job template

A benefit of {ControllerName} is the push-button deployment of Ansible playbooks. 
You can configure a template to store all the parameters that you would normally pass to the Ansible playbook on the command line. 
In addition to the playbooks, the template passes the inventory, credentials, extra variables, and all options and settings that you can specify on the command line.

Easier deployments drive consistency, by running your playbooks the same way each time, and allowing you to delegate responsibilities.

.Procedure

* Launch a job template by using one of these methods:
** From the navigation panel, select menu:Templates[Launch] next to the job template.

+
** In the Job Template Details view of the job template you want to launch, click btn:[Launch].

A job can require additional information to run. 
The following data can be requested at launch:

* Credentials that were setup
* The option *Prompt on Launch* is selected for any parameter
* Passwords or passphrases that have been set to *Ask*
* A survey, if one has been configured for the job templates
* Extra variables, if requested by the job template

[NOTE]
====
If a job has user-provided values, then those are respected upon relaunch. 
If the user did not specify a value, then the job uses the default value from the job template. 
Jobs are not relaunched as-is. 
They are relaunched with the user prompts re-applied to the job template.

.Example
If you provide values on one tab, return to a previous tab, continuing on to the next tab results in having to re-provide values on the rest of the tabs.
Ensure that you fill in the tabs in the order that the prompts appear to avoid this.
