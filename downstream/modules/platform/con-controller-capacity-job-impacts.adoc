= Capacity job impacts

When selecting the capacity, it is important to understand how each job type affects capacity.

The default forks value for Ansible is 5. 
However, if you set up {ControllerName} to run against fewer systems than that, then the actual concurrency value is lower.

When a job is run in {ControllerName}, an additional 1 is added to the number of forks selected to compensate for the Ansible parent process. 

.Example
You are running a playbook against 5 systems with a forks value of 5, then the actual forks value from the perspective of Job Impact will be 6.
