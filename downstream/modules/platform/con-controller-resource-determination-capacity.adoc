= Resource determination for capacity algorithm

The capacity algorithms are defined to determine how many forks a system is capable of running simultaneously. 
This controls how many systems Ansible can communicate with simultaneously. 
Increasing the number of forks an {ControllerName} system is running enables jobs to run faster by performing more work in parallel.
However, this increases the load on the system, which can cause work to slow down.

{ControllerNameStart} can operate in two modes when determining capacity. 
The default `mem_capacity`, enables you to over-commit CPU resources while protecting the system from running out of memory. 
If most of your work is not CPU-bound, then selecting this mode maximizes the number of forks.
