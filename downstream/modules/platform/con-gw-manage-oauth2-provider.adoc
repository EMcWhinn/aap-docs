= Manage `OAUTH2_PROVIDER` settings

[role="_abstract"]

The `OAUTH2_PROVIDER` settings from {ControllerName} are managed by {Gateway} after upgrading from 2.4. to 2.6. 
The default token expiration values might differ between {ControllerName} and {Gateway}.

* The default access token expiration is updated from 1,000 years to 1 year. 
This change increases credential security through more frequent token rotation.
* {GatewayStart}'s default OAUTH2_PROVIDER settings are:
+
----
{
  "ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS": 31536000000,
  "REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS": 2628000,
  "AUTHORIZATION_CODE_EXPIRE_SECONDS": 600
}
----

If you previously set a token expiration shorter than one year, you must manually update the {Gateway} settings to match your required configuration.
