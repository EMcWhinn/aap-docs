= Playbook run jobs

When a playbook is executed, the full results automatically display in the *Output* tab. 
This shows the same information you see if you run it through the Ansible command line, and can be useful for debugging.

The host status bar runs across the top of the *Output* view. 
Hover over a section of the host status bar and the number of hosts associated with that particular status displays.

The output for a playbook job is also accessible after launching a job from the *Jobs* tab of its *Jobs Templates* page.
View its host details by clicking on the line item tasks in the output.
