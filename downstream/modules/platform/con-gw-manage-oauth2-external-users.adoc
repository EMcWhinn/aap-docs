= Manage OAuth2 token creation for external users

[role="_abstract"]

{PlatformName} is designed with a default security posture that prevents users authenticated through external providers, such as LDAP, SAML, or SSO, from creating OAuth2 tokens for programmatic API access. 
When an external user tries to generate such a token, the following message is displayed: 
`403: Forbidden' error with the message: '(access_denied) OAuth2 Tokens cannot be created by users associated with an external authentication provider`.

This default behavior is a deliberate security measure. 
{PlatformNameShort} prioritizes centralized control over token generation, which encourages administrators to select the appropriate method for enabling OAuth 2.0 user token generation for external authentication providers.

It is important to understand that an OAuth2 token is created within {PlatformNameShort}, and {PlatformNameShort} itself manages its lifecycle, including its expiration. 
This lifecycle is independent of the user's session with their external Identity Provider (IdP). 
For example, if a user generates an {PlatformNameShort} token and their account is later disabled in the external IdP, the {PlatformNameShort} token remains valid until it expires or is manually revoked. 
Being aware of this interaction is crucial for a secure configuration, as it highlights the need for compensating controls if you enable token creation for external users.
