= Resetting TOWER_URL_BASE

{ControllerNameStart} determines how the base URL (`TOWER_URL_BASE`) is defined by looking at an incoming request and setting the server address based on that incoming request.

{ControllerNameStart} takes settings values from the database first. 
If no settings values are found, it uses the values from the settings files. 
If you post a license by navigating to the {ControllerName} host's IP address, the posted license is written to the settings entry in the database.

Use the following procedure to reset `TOWER_URL_BASE` if the wrong address has been picked up:

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[Misc. system settings].
. Re-add your license for the DNS entry you wish to appear in notifications.
