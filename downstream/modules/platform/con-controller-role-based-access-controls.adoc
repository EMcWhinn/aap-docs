= Role-based access controls

To edit and delete a workflow job template, you must have the administrator role. 
To create a workflow job template, you must be an organization administrator or a system administrator. 
However, you can run a workflow job template that contains job templates that you do not have permissions for. 
Organization administrators can create a blank workflow and then grant an `admin_role` to a low-level user, after which they can delegate more access and build the graph. 
You must have `execute` access to a job template to add it to a workflow job template.

Other tasks such as the ability to make a duplicate copy and re-launch a workflow can also be performed, depending on what kinds of permissions are granted to a particular user. You must have permissions to all the resources used in a workflow, such as job templates, before relaunching or making a copy.

For more information on performing the tasks described in this section, see the link:http://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.4/html/administration/index.html#ag-start[Administration Guide].
