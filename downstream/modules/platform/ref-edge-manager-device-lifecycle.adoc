= Use device lifecycle hooks

The {RedHatEdge} agent can run user-defined commands at specific points in the device lifecycle by using device lifecycle hooks. 
For example, you can add a shell script to your operating system images that backs up your application data. 
You can then specify that the script must run and complete successfully before the agent can start updating the operating system.

As another example, certain applications or system services do not automatically reload their configuration file when the file changes on the disk. 
You can manually reload the configuration file by specifying a command as another hook, which is called after the agent completes the update process.

The following device lifecycle hooks are supported:

[width="100%",cols="56%,44%",options="header",]
|===
|Lifecycle Hook |Description
|`beforeUpdating` |This hook is called after the agent completed preparing for the update and before actually making changes to the system. 
If an action in this hook returns with failure, the agent cancels the update.

|`afterUpdating` |This hook is called after the agent has written the update to disk. 
If an action in this hook returns with failure,the agent cancels and rolls back the update.

|`beforeRebooting` |This hook is called before the system reboots. The agent blocks the reboot until running the action has completed or timed out. 
If any action in this hook returns with failure, the agent cancels and rolls back the update.

|`afterRebooting` |This hook is called when the agent first starts after a reboot. 
If any action in this hook returns with failure, the agent reports this but continues starting up.
|===

You can define device lifecycle hooks by adding rule files to one of two locations in the device's filesystem, where `${lifecyclehook}` is the all-lower-case name of the hook you want to define:

* Rules in the `/usr/lib/flightctl/hooks.d/${lifecyclehook}/` drop-in directory are read-only.
Therefore, you must add them to the operating system image during ADD LINK[image building].
* Rules in the `/etc/flightctl/hooks.d/${lifecyclehook}/` drop-in directory are read-writable. 
You can update them at runtime by using the methods described in ADD LINK[Managing OS Configuration].

If rules are defined in both locations they are merged, whereby files under `/etc` take precedence over files of the same name under `/usr`. 
If many rule files are added to a hook's directory, they are processed in lexical order of their file names.

A rule file is written in YAML format and has a list of one or more actions. 
An action can be to run an external command ("run action").
When you specify many actions for a hook, these actions are performed in sequence, finishing one action before starting the next. 
If an action returns with failure, later actions are not executed.

A run action takes the following parameters:

[width="100%",cols="45%,55%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Run |The absolute path to the command to run, followed by any flags or arguments. 

Example: `/usr/bin/nmcli connection reload`. 

Note that the command is not executed in a shell, so you cannot use shell variables like `$PATH` or `$HOME` or chain commands (`\|` or `;`). However, it is possible to start a shell yourself if necessary by specifying the shell as command to run. 

Example: `/usr/bin/bash -c 'echo $SHELL $HOME $USER'`

|EnvVars |(Optional) A list of key/value-pairs to set as environment variables for the command.

|WorkDir |(Optional) The directory the command is run from.

|Timeout |(Optional) The maximum duration allowed for the action to complete. Specify the duration as a single positive integer followed by a time unit. 
The following time units are supported: `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, and `h` for hours.

|If |(Optional) A list of conditions that must be true for the action to be run. 
If not provided, actions run unconditionally.
|===

By default, actions are performed every time the hook is triggered.
However, for the `afterUpdating` hook you can use the `If` parameter to add conditions that must be true for an action to be performed, otherwise the action is skipped.

In particular, to only run an action if a given file or directory has changed during the update, you can define a "path condition" that takes the following parameters:

[width="100%",cols="45%,55%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Path |An absolute path to a file or directory that must have changed during the update as condition for the action to be performed. Specify paths by using forward slashes (`/`) and if the path is to a directory it must end with a forward slash `/`. 

If you specify a path to a file, the file must have changed to satisfy the condition. 
If you specify a path to a directory, a file in that directory or any of its subdirectories must have changed to satisfy the condition.

|On |A list of file operations (`created`, `updated`, `removed`) to further limit the kind of changes to the specified path as condition for the action to be performed.
|===

If you have specified a "path condition" for an action in the `afterUpdating` hook, you have the following variables that you can include in arguments to your command and are replaced with the absolute paths to the changed files:

[width="100%",cols="43%,57%",options="header",]
|===
|Variable |Description
|`{{ Path }}` |The absolute path to the file or directory specified in the path condition.

|`{{ Files }}` |A space-separated list of absolute paths of the files that were changed (created, updated, or removed) during the update and are covered by the path condition.

|`{{ CreatedFiles }}` |A space-separated list of absolute paths of the files that were changed (created, updated, or removed) during the update and are covered by the path condition.

|`{{ UpdatedFiles }}` |A space-separated list of absolute paths of the files that were updated during the update and are covered by the path condition.

|`{{ RemovedFiles }}` |A space-separated list of absolute paths of the files that were removed during the update and are covered by the path condition.

The {RedHatEdge} agent includes a built-in set of rules defined in `/usr/lib/flightctl/hooks.d/afterupdating/00-default.yaml`:

[width="100%",cols="50%,28%,22%",options="header",]
|===
|If you change the following files |then the agent runs |Description
|`/etc/systemd/system/` |`systemctl daemon-reload` |Changes to systemd units are activated by signaling the systemd daemon to reload the systemd manager configuration. 
This reruns all generators, reloads all unit files, and re-creates the entire dependency tree.

|`/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/` |`nmcli conn reload` |Changes to Network Manager system connections are activated by signaling Network Manager to reload all connections.

|`/etc/firewalld/` |`firewall-cmd --reload` |Changes to firewalld's permanent configuration are activated by signaling firewalld to reload firewall rules as new runtime configuration.
