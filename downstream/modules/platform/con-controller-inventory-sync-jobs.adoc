= Inventory sync jobs

When an inventory synchronization is executed, the full results display in the *Output* tab. 
This shows the same information if you run it through the Ansible command line, and can be useful for debugging. 
The `ANSIBLE_DISPLAY_ARGS_TO_STDOUT` is set to `False` by default for all playbook runs. 
This matches Ansible's default behavior.
This does not display task arguments in task headers in the *Job Detail* interface to avoid leaking certain sensitive module parameters to `stdout`. 
To restore the previous behavior, you can set `ANSIBLE_DISPLAY_ARGS_TO_STDOUT` to `True` through the `AWX_TASK_ENV` configuration setting. 

For more information, see link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#envvar-ANSIBLE_DISPLAY_ARGS_TO_STDOUT[ANSIBLE_DISPLAY_ARGS_TO_STDOUT].

[NOTE]
====
You can perform an inventory update while a related job is running. 
In cases where you have a large project (around 10 GB), disk space on `/tmp` can be an issue.
