= Personal Access Token migration

After upgrading to {PlatformNameShort} 2.6, Personal Access Tokens (PATs) from a 2.4 {ControllerName} remain functional. 
They are visible in the {Gateway} UI and you can use them with both {ControllerName} and {Gateway} APIs.

*Managing automation controller tokens*

After the upgrade, you can perform the following actions with your {ControllerName} tokens:

* *{GatewayStart} UI*: You can edit or delete the tokens, but you cannot create or refresh them.
* *{ControllerNameStart}* API: You can create, edit, delete, or refresh the tokens.

Tokens are labeled in the UI to indicate if they are {ControllerName} only or {Gateway}. 
{GatewayStart} tokens are unaffected by these requirements, other than being rendered in the UI with a "platform" type.
