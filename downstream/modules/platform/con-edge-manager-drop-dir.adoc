= Drop-in directories

Use drop-in directories to add, replace, or remove configuration files that the service aggregates.
Do not directly edit your configuration files that might cause deviation from the target configuration.

[NOTE]
====
You can identify drop-in directories by the `.d/` at the end of the directory name.
For example, `/etc/containers/certs.d`, `/etc/cron.d`, and `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d`.
