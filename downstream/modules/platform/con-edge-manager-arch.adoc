= {RedHatEdge} architecture

The {RedHatEdge} uses an agent-based architecture that allows for a scalable and robust device management, even with limited network conditions.
By deploying a {RedHatEdge} agent to a device, the agent autonomously manages and monitors the device while periodically communicating with the {RedHatEdge} service to check for new configurations and to report device status.

The {RedHatEdge} supports image-based operating systems.
You can include the {RedHatEdge} agent and the agent configuration in the image that is distributed to the devices.
Image-based operating systems allow the agent to start a transactional update of the image and to roll back to the earlier version in case of an update error.

The {RedHatEdge} architecture has the following main features:

* Agent
* Service
* Image-based operating system
* API server 
* Database
* Device
* Device fleet
