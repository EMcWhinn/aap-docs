= Building the QCoW2 disk image

Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization can download disk images from an OCI registry but it expects a container disk image instead of an OCI artifact. 

Complete the following steps to build, sign, and upload the QCoW2 disk image:

.Procedure

. Create a file called `Containerfile.qcow2` with the following content:

+
[source,bash]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest AS builder
ADD --chown=107:107 output/qcow2/disk.qcow2 /disk/ <1>
RUN chmod 0440 /disk/* <2>
FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /disk/* /disk/ <3>
----
<1> Adds the QCoW2 disk image to a builder container to set the required `107` file ownership, which is the QEMU user.
<2> Sets the required `0440` file permissions. 
<3> Copies the file to a scratch image.

. Build, sign, and publish your disk image by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) "${PWD}/output"
OCI_DISK_IMAGE_REPO=${OCI_IMAGE_REPO}/diskimage-qcow2
sudo podman build -t ${OCI_DISK_IMAGE_REPO}:${OCI_IMAGE_TAG} -f Containerfile.qcow2 .
sudo podman push --sign-by-sigstore-private-key ./signingkey.private ${OCI_DISK_IMAGE_REPO}:${OCI_IMAGE_TAG}
