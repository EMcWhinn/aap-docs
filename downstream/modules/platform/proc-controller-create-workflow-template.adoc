If a field has the *Prompt on launch* checkbox selected, launching the workflow template, or when the workflow template is used within another workflow template, you are prompted for the value for that field.
Most prompted values override any values set in the job template.

|===
| *Field* | *Options* | *Prompt on Launch* 
| Name | Enter a name for the job.| N/A
| Description| Enter an arbitrary description as appropriate (optional). | N/A
| Organization | Choose the organization to be used with this template from the organizations available to the logged in user. | N/A
| Inventory | Optionally, choose the inventory to be used with this template from the inventories available to the logged in user. | Yes
| Limit | A host pattern to further constrain the list of hosts managed or affected by the playbook. Multiple patterns can be separated by colons (:).
As with core Ansible, a:b means "in group a or b", a:b:&c means "in a or b but must be in c", and a:!b means "in a, and definitely not in b".
For more information see, link:http://docs.ansible.com/intro_patterns.html[Patterns] in the Ansible documentation. | Yes
| Source control branch | Select a branch for the workflow. This branch is applied to all workflow job template nodes that prompt for a branch. | Yes
| Labels 
a| 
- Optionally, supply labels that describe this workflow job template, such as `dev` or `test`. 
Labels can be used to group and filter workflow job templates and completed jobs in the display. 

- Labels are created when they are added to the workflow template. 
Labels are associated to a single Organization using the Project that is provided in the workflow template. 
Members of the Organization can create labels on a workflow template if they have edit permissions (such as the admin role).

- Once the job template is saved, the labels appear in the workflow job templates *Details* view.

- Labels are only applied to the workflow templates not the job template nodes that are used in the workflow.

- Select image:disassociate.png[Disassociate,10,10] beside a label to remove it. 
When a label is removed, it is no longer associated with that particular Job or Job Template, but it will remain associated with any other jobs that reference it.
