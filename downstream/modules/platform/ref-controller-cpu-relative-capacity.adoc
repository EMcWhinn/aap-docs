= CPU relative capacity

Ansible workloads are often CPU-bound.
In these cases, you can reduce the simultaneous workload to enable more tasks to run faster and reduce the average time-to-completion of those jobs.

Just as the `mem_capacity` algorithm uses the amount of memory required per fork, the `cpu_capacity` algorithm looks at the amount of CPU resources required per fork. 
The baseline value for this is 4 forks per core. 
The algorithm formula for this is:

----
cpus * fork_per_cpu
----

For example, a 4-core system looks like the following:

----
4 * 4 == 16
----

You can control the value fork_per_cpu by setting the value of `SYSTEM_TASK_FORKS_CPU` which defaults to 4.
