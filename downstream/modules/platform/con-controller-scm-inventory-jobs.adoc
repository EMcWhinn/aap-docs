= SCM inventory jobs

When an inventory sourced from an SCM is executed, the full results automatically display in the *Output* tab. 
This shows the same information you see if you run it through the Ansible command line, and can be useful for debugging.
Use the icons in the navigation menu to relaunch (image:rightrocket.png[Rightrocket,15,15]), download (image:download.png[Download,15,15]) the job output, or delete (image:delete-button.png[Delete,15,15]) the job.
