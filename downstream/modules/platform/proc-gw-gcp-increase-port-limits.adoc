= Increasing the minimum ports

[role="_abstract"]

To address this limitation, manually increase the *Minimum ports per VM instance* setting for the Cloud NAT gateway associated with the worker nodes.

Use the Google Cloud Console to apply this workaround.

.Procedure

. Go to the link:https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/nat/[Cloud NAT service].
. Locate and select the NAT gateway configured for your OpenShift cluster's worker nodes.
. Increase the default value of 64 for the *Minimum ports per VM instance* setting to a higher value to accommodate your anticipated traffic volume.
+
Increasing this limit ensures enough available ports for external communication, reducing the likelihood of performance issues during high-volume authentication and external communication tasks.
