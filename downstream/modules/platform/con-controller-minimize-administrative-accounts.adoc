= Minimize administrative accounts

Minimizing the access to system administrative accounts is crucial for maintaining a secure system. 
A system administrator or root user can access, edit, and disrupt any system application. 
Keep the number of people or accounts with root access to as small of a group as possible. Do not give out sudo to root or awx (the controller user) to untrusted users. Know that when restricting administrative access via mechanisms like sudo, that restricting to a certain set of commands may still give a wide range of access. Any command that allows for execution of a shell or arbitrary shell commands, or any command that can change files on the system, is fundamentally equivalent to full root access.
