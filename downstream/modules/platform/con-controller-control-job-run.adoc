[id="controller-control-job-run"]

= Control where a job runs

If any of the job template, inventory, or organization has instance groups associated with them, a job run from that job template is not eligible for the default behavior. 
This means that if all of the instances inside of the instance groups associated with these three resources are out of capacity, the job remains in the pending state until capacity becomes available.

The order of preference in determining which instance group to submit the job to is as follows:

. Job template
. Inventory
. Organization (by way of project)

If instance groups are associated with the job template, and all of these are at capacity, then the job is submitted to instance groups specified on the inventory, and then the organization. 
Jobs must execute in those groups in preferential order as resources are available.

The global `default` group can still be associated with a resource, just like any of the custom instance groups defined in the playbook. 
This can be used to specify a preferred instance group on the job template or inventory, but still allow the job to be submitted to any instance if those are out of capacity.

.Examples

* If you associate `group_a` with a job template and also associate the `default` group with its inventory, you allow the `default` group to be used as a fallback in case `group_a` gets out of capacity.
* In addition, it is possible to not associate an instance group with one resource but designate another resource as the fallback. 
For example, not associating an instance group with a job template and have it fall back to the inventory or the organization's instance group.

This presents the following two examples:

. Associating instance groups with an inventory (omitting assigning the job template to an instance group) allows the user to ensure that any playbook run against a specific inventory runs only on the group associated with it. 
This useful in the situation where only those instances have a direct link to the managed nodes.
. An administrator can assign instance groups to organizations. 
This effectively allows the administrator to segment out the entire infrastructure and guarantee that each organization has capacity to run jobs without interfering with any other organization's ability to run jobs.

An administrator can assign multiple groups to each organization, as in the following scenario:
+
* There are three instance groups: _A_, _B_, and _C_. 
There are two organizations: _Org1_ and _Org2_.
* The administrator assigns group _A_ to _Org1_, group _B_ to _Org2_ and then assign group _C_ to both _Org1_ and _Org2_ as an overflow for any extra capacity that may be needed.
* The organization administrators are then free to assign inventory or job templates to whichever group they want, or let them inherit the default order from the organization.

Arranging resources this way offers you flexibility.
You can also create instance groups with only one instance, allowing you to direct work towards a very specific Host in the controller cluster.
