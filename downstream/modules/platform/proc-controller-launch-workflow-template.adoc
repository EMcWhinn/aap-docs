+
** Click btn:[Launch] in the *Details* tab of the workflow job template that you want to launch.

Along with any extra variables set in the workflow job template and survey, the same variables as those added for a workflow job template are automatically added in {ControllerName} when launching.

Events related to approvals on workflows display in the activity stream (image:activitystream.png[Activity stream,15,15]) with detailed information about the approval requests, if any.
