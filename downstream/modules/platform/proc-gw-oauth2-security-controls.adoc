= Implementing security controls for external user OAuth2 tokens

[role="_abstract"]

After enabling OAuth2 token creation for external users, implement the following compensating controls to keep a strong security posture.

.Procedure

* *Limit token lifetime*: Configure a shorter duration for OAuth2 tokens to reduce the window of exposure.
** In your {PlatformNameShort} settings, adjust the `OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS value`. 
A value of 28800 (8 hours) is recommended, limiting token validity to a standard workday. 
* *Enforce strict role-based access control (RBAC)*: Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions. 
** Assign users who create tokens to *Teams* with highly restrictive roles. 
Avoid granting broad permissions that could lead to privilege escalation. 
* *Establish a clear offboarding process*: Integrate token revocation into your organizational offboarding procedures. 
Your HR and IT offboarding processes must include a step for an {PlatformNameShort} administrator to revoke all active tokens for a departing user. 
Tokens can be manually revoked from the user's profile under the *Tokens* tab. 
* *Audit and monitor*: Regularly review token-related activities for legitimacy in the *Activity Stream*.
