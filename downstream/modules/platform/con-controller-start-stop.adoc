[id="controller-start-stop"]

External databases must be explicitly managed by the administrator. 
The services script resides in `/usr/bin/automation-controller-service` and can be invoked as follows:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
root@localhost:~$ automation-controller-service restart
----

[NOTE]
====
In clustered installs, `automation-controller-service` restart does not include PostgreSQL as part of the services that are restarted because it exists external to {ControllerName} and because PostgreSQL does not always need to be restarted. 
Use `systemctl restart automation-controller` to restart services on clustered environments instead. 
You must also restart each cluster node for certain changes to persist as opposed to a single node for a localhost install. 
For more information on clustered environments, see the Clustering section.
====

You can also invoke the services script using distribution-specific service management commands. 
Distribution packages often provide a similar script, sometimes as an init script, to manage services. 
Refer to your distribution-specific service management system for more information.

[NOTE]
====
When running {ControllerName} in a container, do not use the `automation-controller-service script`.
Restart the pod using the container environment instead.
