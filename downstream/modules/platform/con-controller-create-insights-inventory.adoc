= Create an Insights inventory

The Insights playbook contains a `hosts:` line where the value is the hostname that Red Hat Insights itself knows about, which may be different from the hostname that {ControllerName} knows about. 
To use a Red Hat Insights playbook, you must use an Red Hat Insights inventory.

To create a new inventory to use with Red Hat Insights, see xref:proc-controller-inv-source-insights[Creating Insights credentials].
