= Post installation steps for VM-based install

You need to complete post-install steps for setting up {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 with {EDAcontroller} 1.1 and {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 with {HubName} 4.9. 
The installation program does not handle the creation of decision environments and credentials in this scenario. 
See the following steps to complete the installation:

. Upload the 2.5 [ADD LINK FOR namespace for 2.5 image will be "ansible-automation-platform-25] de-supported decision environment to {HubName}. 
For more information, see link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html-single/managing_content_in_automation_hub/index#push-containers[ Pushing a container image to private automation hub].

[NOTE]
====
If you are doing a bundle install, the image is included in the setup bundle .tar file.
====
+
. Create an {HubName} container registry credential in {EDAName}.
