= Monitoring device resources on the CLI

Effectively monitor the resources of your device through the CLI, providing you with the tools and commands to track performance and troubleshoot issues.

.Procedure

* To check resource use, add resource monitors in the `resources:` section of the device's specification.

.Example

Check disk use on the filesystem associated with the path /applications, which can trigger a warning alert if the average use exceeds 75% for more than 30 minutes and a critical alert if it exceeds 90% for over 10 minutes with a sampling interval of 5 seconds.
