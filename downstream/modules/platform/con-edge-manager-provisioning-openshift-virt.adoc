= Provisioning devices on OpenShift Virtualization

You can provision a virtual machine on OpenShift Virtualization by using a QCoW2 container disk image that is hosted on an OCI container registry.

If your operating system image does not already contain the {RedHatEdge} agent enrollment configuration, you can inject the configuration through the `cloud-init` user data at provisioning.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the `flightctl` CLI and logged in to your {RedHatEdge} service instance.
* You installed the `oc` CLI, used it to log in to your OpenShift cluster instance, and changed to the project in which you want to create your virtual machine.
